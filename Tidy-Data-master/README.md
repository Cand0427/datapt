# Tidy Data in Python

A Python exercise motivated by this nice article from Hadley Wickham: [Tidy Data](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf). Reading this paper is a nice prerequisite for this notebook.

The code in this notebook was originally developed and commented by [Jean-François Puget](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp?lang=en) in a blog post on "[Tidy Data In Python](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Tidy_Data_In_Python?lang=en)".
